**Agricultural Productivity Analysis Using Power BI**
This project explores agricultural productivity across various Indian states through dynamic data visualization using Power BI. Conducted over three weeks, the study delves into crop production metrics to uncover trends, regional distinctions, and influencing factors.

ðŸ”¹ Week 1: Foundational Analysis & Core Visuals
The initial phase involved data preparation, including importing and cleaning crop-wise, state-wise, and year-wise agricultural datasets.

Key visualizations created:

Line Graph (Rainfall vs Area): Demonstrates a moderate shift in cultivated area corresponding to annual rainfall variations.

Area Chart (Fertilizer vs Production): Reveals a peak in fertilizer application at mid-level production, followed by a decline.

Line Graph (Crop vs Year): Indicates a declining trend in crop values over time, with â€˜Uradâ€™ showing the highest and â€˜Sweet Potatoâ€™ the lowest.

Donut Chart (Pesticide by State): Highlights pesticide usage by state, with Uttar Pradesh leading in usage.

ðŸ”¹ Week 2: Enhanced Visuals & Interactive Reporting
This stage deepened the analysis by focusing on the link between fertilizer application and crop production across states and years.

Visuals developed include:

KPI Cards: Summarize key metrics like average crop output, peak fertilizer usage, average yield, and count of distinct crops analyzed.

Bar Chart: Showcases the highest yield values by crop year, offering a timeline-based yield assessment.

Pie Chart: Displays the distribution of minimum rainfall across states, revealing geographic rainfall disparities and their potential effects on farming.

Combo Chart (Line & Column): Compares average production with total fertilizer usage across crop types, offering insight into input-output relationships.

Slicers: Provide interactive filtering by Crop Year for more focused time-based analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Week 3: Yield Visualization & Trend Monitoring
Built a Filled Map to show average crop yield by state.
Designed a Line Chart to track production trends by crop over the years.
Incorporated slicers to filter by crop, year, and state for tailored insights.

Conclusion:
This Power BI project effectively translates raw agricultural data into actionable insights. It uncovers production dynamics, highlights crop-specific trends, and visualizes regional yield differences through an engaging, interactive dashboard experience.
